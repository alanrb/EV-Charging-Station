### Add-to-app
Itâ€™s sometimes not practical to rewrite your entire application in Flutter all at once. For those situations, Flutter can be integrated into your existing application piecemeal, as a library or module. That module can then be imported into your Android or iOS (currently supported platforms) app to render a part of your appâ€™s UI in Flutter. Or, just to run shared Dart logic.

In a few steps, you can bring the productivity and the expressiveness of Flutter into your own app.

The  `add-to-app`  feature supports integrating multiple instances of any screen size. This can help scenarios such as a hybrid navigation stack with mixed native and Flutter screens, or a page with multiple partial-screen Flutter views.

Having multiple Flutter instances allows each instance to maintain independent application and UI state while using minimal memory resources. See more in the  [multiple Flutters](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/add-to-app/multiple-flutters)  page.


Letâ€™s assume that you have an existing app at  `some/path/EVChargingStationAndroid`, and that you want your Flutter project as a sibling:

```
cd some/path/
$ flutter create -t module --org com.github.alanrb ev_charging_station_flutter
```

```
some/path/
â”œâ”€â”€ ev_charging_station_flutter/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build/host/outputs/repo
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .ios/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Flutter/
â”‚         â””â”€â”€ podhelper.rb
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationAndroid/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.gradle
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationiOS/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Podfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Flutter
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Debug
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Release

```

## Android
### Setup - Depend on the Android Archive (AAR)

Letâ€™s assume you built a Flutter module at  `some/path/ev_charging_station_flutter`, and then run:

```
cd some/path/ev_charging_station_flutter
flutter build aar
```

You will get the output:
```ruby

ðŸ’ª Building with sound null safety ðŸ’ª

Running Gradle task 'assembleAarDebug'...                          43.4s
âœ“ Built build/host/outputs/repo.
Running Gradle task 'assembleAarProfile'...                        40.8s
âœ“ Built build/host/outputs/repo.
Running Gradle task 'assembleAarRelease'...                        41.3s
âœ“ Built build/host/outputs/repo.

Consuming the Module
  1. Open <host>/app/build.gradle
  2. Ensure you have the repositories configured, otherwise add them:

      String storageUrl = System.env.FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL ?: "https://storage.googleapis.com"
      repositories {
        maven {
            url '/some/path/EV-Charging-Station/ev_charging_station_flutter/build/host/outputs/repo'
        }
        maven {
            url "$storageUrl/download.flutter.io"
        }
      }

  3. Make the host app depend on the Flutter module:

    dependencies {
      debugImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_debug:1.0'
      profileImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_profile:1.0'
      releaseImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_release:1.0'
    }


  4. Add the `profile` build type:

    android {
      buildTypes {
        profile {
          initWith debug
        }
      }
    }

```

Letâ€™s open the [settings.gradle](https://github.com/alanrb/EV-Charging-Station/blob/main/EVChargingStationAndroid/settings.gradle) and edit the section under `dependencyResolutionManagement`
```ruby
pluginManagement {  
  
  repositories {  
  gradlePluginPortal()  
        google()  
        mavenCentral()  
    }  
}  
dependencyResolutionManagement {  
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.PREFER_SETTINGS)  
    String storageUrl = System.env.FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL ?: "https://storage.googleapis.com"  
  repositories {  
  google()  
        mavenCentral()  
        maven {  
  url '../ev_charging_station_flutter/build/host/outputs/repo'  
  }  
  maven {  
  url "$storageUrl/download.flutter.io"  
  }  
 }}  
rootProject.name = "EVChargingStation"  
include ':app'
```
Next step, open  [app/build.gradle](https://github.com/alanrb/EV-Charging-Station/blob/main/EVChargingStationAndroid/app/build.gradle)  in host app `EVChargingStationAndroid` so that it includes the dependency:
```gradle
debugImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_debug:1.0'  
profileImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_profile:1.0'  
releaseImplementation 'com.github.alanrb.ev_charging_station_flutter:flutter_release:1.0'
```
```
some/path/
â”œâ”€â”€ ev_charging_station_flutter/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ host
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ outputs
â”‚                â””â”€â”€ repo
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .ios/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Flutter/
â”‚         â””â”€â”€ podhelper.rb
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationAndroid/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.gradle
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ build.gradle
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationiOS/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Podfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Flutter
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Debug
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Release
```
### Implement FlutterFragmentActivity from your app
- In Application:
```kotlin
class App: Application() {  
    lateinit var engines: FlutterEngineGroup  
  
    override fun onCreate() {  
        super.onCreate()  
        engines = FlutterEngineGroup(this)  
    }  
}
```

- Create [EngineBindings](https://github.com/alanrb/EV-Charging-Station/blob/main/EVChargingStationAndroid/app/src/main/java/com/github/alanrb/evchargingstation/ui/main/EngineBindings.kt) to binds a FlutterEngine instance and a channel for communicating with that engine.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : FlutterFragmentActivity() {  
    private val engineBindings: EngineBindings by lazy {  
      EngineBindings(activity = this, entrypoint = "main", channelName = "multiple-flutters")  
    }  
  
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  
        engineBindings.attach { call, result ->
          when (call.method) {  
                "station_show_details" -> {
                  // Handle event
                  result.success(null)  
                }  
                else -> {  
                    result.notImplemented()  
                }  
            }  
        }  
  }  
  
    override fun onDestroy() {  
        super.onDestroy()  
        engineBindings.detach()  
    }  
  
    override fun provideFlutterEngine(context: Context): FlutterEngine {  
        return engineBindings.engine  
  }  
}
```
## iOS
### Setup - Embed application and plugin frameworks in Xcode and Flutter framework with CocoaPods
#### Setting up CocoaPods
- In case your host project doesn't already use **CocoaPods**, you need to create a  `Podfile`. If you already have a  **Podfile**  created in your iOS project, then you can skip the first step.
- Run this command from the iOS project directory:
```bash
cd some/path/EVChargingStationiOS
pod init
pod install
```

- Alternatively, instead of distributing the large **Flutter.framework** to other developers, machines, or continuous integration systems, you can instead generate **Flutter** as CocoaPods podspec. This produces a `Flutter.podspec` instead of an engine **Flutter.framework**. The **App.framework** and plugin frameworks will be generated as described in [Option B](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup#option-b---embed-frameworks-in-xcode).

```
flutter build ios-framework --cocoapods --output=../EVChargingStationiOS/Flutter
```
Output:
```ruby

Frameworks written to /some/path/EV-Charging-Station/ev_charging_station_flutter/../EVChargingStationiOS/Flutter.
```

Host apps `EVChargingStationiOS` using CocoaPods to add Flutter to Podfile:
```bash
pod 'Flutter', :podspec => 'Flutter/Debug/Flutter.podspec'
or
pod 'Flutter', :podspec => 'Flutter/Release/Flutter.podspec'
```

Run `pod install` from `some/path/EVChargingStationiOS` again and you should see Flutter framework pods being installed.

You can now open the `EVChargingStationiOS` project in Xcode again by directing Xcode to the  `some/path/EVChargingStationiOS/EVChargingStationiOS.xcworkspace`  file, (**not**  the  `.xcodeproj`  file!).

Your project layout in Xcode now looks as follows:
```
some/path/
â”œâ”€â”€ ev_charging_station_flutter/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ build/host/outputs/repo
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .ios/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Flutter/
â”‚         â””â”€â”€ podhelper.rb
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationAndroid/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.gradle
â””â”€â”€ EVChargingStationiOS/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Podfile
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Pods/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Flutter/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Debug
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Release
```

#### Add a build phase for building the Dart code
- For example, you can drag the frameworks from  `some/path/EVChargingStationiOS/Flutter/Release/`  in Finder into your targetâ€™s  **Build Settings > Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries**.

- In the targetâ€™s build settings, add  `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/Release/`  to the  **Framework Search Paths**  (`FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS`).
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanrb/EV-Charging-Station/main/screenshot/xc_search_path.png)

- By **Build Settings > User-defined**, add a `FLUTTER_ROOT` as the Flutter sdk path.
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanrb/EV-Charging-Station/main/screenshot/xc_sdk_path.png)

- And then select the **Build Phases** tab, add `Thin Binary` script as follows:
```bash
/bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" embed_and_thin
```

### Implement FlutterViewController from your app
To launch a Flutter screen from an existing iOS, you start a  [`FlutterEngine`](https://api.flutter.dev/objcdoc/Classes/FlutterEngine.html)  and a  [`FlutterViewController`](https://api.flutter.dev/objcdoc/Classes/FlutterViewController.html).
> The `FlutterEngine` serves as a host to the Dart VM and your Flutter runtime, and the `FlutterViewController` attaches to a `FlutterEngine` to pass UIKit input events into Flutter and to display frames rendered by the `FlutterEngine`.

In AppDelegate:
```swift
import Flutter
@main
class  AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
  let engines = FlutterEngineGroup(name: "multiple-flutters-group", project: nil)

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    return  true
  }
}
```

```swift
import Flutter
import FlutterPluginRegistrant

class MainVC: FlutterViewController {
  private var channel: FlutterMethodChannel?
  init(withEntrypoint entryPoint: String?) {
    let appDelegate: AppDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
    let newEngine = appDelegate.engines.makeEngine(withEntrypoint: entryPoint, libraryURI: nil)
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: newEngine)
    super.init(engine: newEngine, nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
  }
  
  required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
  }

  override func  viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    channel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: "multiple-flutters", binaryMessenger:self.engine!.binaryMessenger)
    channel!.setMethodCallHandler { (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: **@escaping** FlutterResult) in
      if call.method == "station_show_details" {
        // Handle event
        result(nil)
      } else {
        result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
